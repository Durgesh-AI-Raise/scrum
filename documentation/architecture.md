# Review Guardian MVP Architecture

The "Review Guardian" MVP will employ a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Components:

*   **Frontend (Web Application):** Developed using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React) to provide the anti-abuse analyst dashboard and detailed review views. It will communicate with the backend services via RESTful APIs.
*   **Backend Services:**
    *   **Detection Service:** Responsible for ingesting review data, applying various detection algorithms (e.g., suspicious patterns, coordinated abuse), and generating potential abuse alerts.
    *   **Alerts Service:** Manages the lifecycle of alerts generated by the Detection Service. It stores alerts, provides filtering capabilities, and exposes APIs for the frontend dashboard.
    *   **Review Management Service:** Handles detailed information about reviews, allows for updating their disposition status (legitimate/abusive), and orchestrates the removal process by interacting with external (Amazon.com) systems.
*   **Database:** A PostgreSQL database will serve as the primary data store for all services, holding review metadata, alerts, reviewer profiles, and disposition records.
*   **Message Queue (e.g., Apache Kafka):** An event-driven approach will be used for ingestion of new review data and for internal service communication (e.g., Detection Service publishing alerts, which the Alerts Service subscribes to). This ensures decoupled and resilient processing.
*   **API Gateway:** An API Gateway will be used to route requests from the frontend to the appropriate backend services, providing a single entry point and handling concerns like authentication/authorization.

## Technical Decisions:

*   **Language:** Python for backend services (due to its rich ecosystem for data processing and ease of development) and JavaScript/TypeScript for the frontend.
*   **Frameworks:** Flask/FastAPI for backend APIs, React for the frontend.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for its reliability, ACID compliance, and strong support for structured data.
*   **Deployment:** Containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes for scalable and robust deployment.
*   **Logging & Monitoring:** Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) will be crucial for operational visibility.
