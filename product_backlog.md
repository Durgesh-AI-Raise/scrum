Hello Scrum Master,

Thank you for reaching out! Here is a proposed prioritized product backlog for our e-commerce application. I've focused on core functionalities to get us started.

**Prioritized Product Backlog:**

1.  **User Story:** As a Customer, I want to view a list of products so I can browse available items.
    *   **Description:** Implement a product listing page showing available items with basic details (name, price, image).
    *   **Priority:** High
2.  **User Story:** As a Customer, I want to search for products by keyword so I can quickly find specific items.
    *   **Description:** Add a search bar that filters products based on keywords in name or description.
    *   **Priority:** High
3.  **User Story:** As a Customer, I want to add products to a shopping cart so I can prepare my order.
    *   **Description:** Implement functionality to add items to a temporary shopping cart.
    *   **Priority:** Medium
4.  **User Story:** As a Customer, I want to proceed to checkout so I can purchase items in my cart.
    *   **Description:** Develop a checkout process including entering shipping details and payment information (placeholder for now).
    *   **Priority:** Medium
5.  **User Story:** As a Customer, I want to create an account so I can save my shipping information and order history.
    *   **Description:** Implement user registration and login functionality.
    *   **Priority:** Low
6.  **User Story:** As an Admin, I want to add new products to the catalog so I can manage inventory.
    *   **Description:** Develop an admin interface to add new products with details like name, description, price, stock, and image.
    *   **Priority:** Medium
7.  **User Story:** As an Admin, I want to update existing product details so I can maintain accurate information.
    *   **Description:** Implement an admin interface to edit product information.
    *   **Priority:** Medium

I'm looking forward to your proposed Sprint Goal and the refined Sprint Backlog based on these items. Once I receive the Sprint Backlog with detailed tasks, I will proceed with:

1.  Describing the implementation plan for each task.
2.  Defining data models and architecture.
3.  Listing assumptions and technical decisions.
4.  Providing code snippets or pseudocode for key components.
5.  Using the GitHub tool to commit and push the generated code/documentation to the repository.
