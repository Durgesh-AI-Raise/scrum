# P1.1: Research NLP library for text processing - Summary

**Objective:** Identify a suitable Python NLP library for detecting suspicious language patterns in reviews.

**Evaluated Libraries:**
1.  **spaCy:**
    *   **Pros:** Fast, efficient, production-ready, excellent for tokenization, POS tagging, NER, dependency parsing. Good for rule-based matching. Has pre-trained models.
    *   **Cons:** Models can be large.
    *   **Suitability:** High. Its performance and built-in linguistic features make it ideal for identifying unnatural phrasing and robust keyword extraction.

2.  **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):**
    *   **Pros:** Comprehensive, widely used in academia, good for research and prototyping, extensive algorithms.
    *   **Cons:** Can be slower than spaCy for large-scale processing, less optimized for production.
    *   **Suitability:** Moderate. Good for foundational tasks, but spaCy is often preferred for speed in microservices.

3.  **TextBlob:**
    *   **Pros:** Simple API, built on NLTK, includes sentiment analysis out-of-the-box.
    *   **Cons:** Less performant and flexible than spaCy for advanced tasks.
    *   **Suitability:** Low-Moderate. Useful for quick sentiment, but not robust enough for detailed pattern detection.

**Recommendation:**
`spaCy` is the recommended library for its balance of performance, features, and production readiness. It provides the necessary tools for robust text processing required for detecting unnatural phrasing, repeated keywords, and other suspicious patterns efficiently.

**Next Steps:** Proceed with integrating spaCy into the text pattern detection microservice.
